# Covid19-Global-Data-Tracker

## Project Description
This project is a data analysis notebook that tracks global COVID-19 trends, including cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across multiple countries.
It uses real-world data to generate visualizations, explore patterns, and present key insights.

## Project Objectives
Import and clean COVID-19 global data

Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)

Compare metrics across selected countries (Kenya, USA, India)

Visualize trends with clear charts and graphs

Communicate findings through code and narrative explanations

## Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Plotly Express (optional) for interactive world map

Jupyter Notebook for presenting code, visuals, and insights

## How to Run the Project
Clone or download this repository.

Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

Install required libraries if you don't have them:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly

Open the covid_tracker.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.

Run the notebook cells to view the analysis, charts, and insights.

## Insights & Reflections
The United States consistently had the highest total cases among the selected countries.

India experienced a sharp surge in cases during mid-2021.

Kenyaâ€™s vaccination efforts gained momentum later compared to the other countries.

Death rates decreased over time, likely due to improved healthcare response and vaccine rollouts.

Visualizing data trends helped reveal patterns not easily seen in raw numbers alone.
